Reference link: [Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

**Note - the early days until 17 or so are done using the online replit and coding rooms, not a local development environment**

Virtual environment is using pyenv with python version 3.11.3 (as at May 2023).

Currently working through paper scissors rock in day 4.

Now adding black and ruff with both github actions and precommit into the mix.

Precommit is now working, next stop github actions.

Next steps:
* Use ruff and include pylint rules.
* then implement python super linter rules
